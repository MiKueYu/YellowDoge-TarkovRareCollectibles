# YellowDoge-TarkovRareCollectibles

Do you remember the feeling of finding your first GPU? Do you still remember the excitement of discovering your first LEDX? Don't you feel that looting in Tarkov nowadays has become a lot more boring? Only marked keys, Lab key cards, and maybe LEDX still give you enough adrenaline. This mod aims to fix that.

Inspired by other extraction shooters like Arena Breakout: Infinite and Delta Force, **Tarkov Rare Collectibles** is a mod that adds rare collectible items to Escape from Tarkov. These items are highly valuable and extremely rare, often worth over 1 million rubles. Once you find them, you can sell them for a fortune or collect them in your Hall of Fame.

## Installation

1. Extract user/ folder to SPT root directory

## TODO (Once I figure out how to)

1. Add Loose Loot Spawns (Power Cell/Deer Skull will be Loose Loot only probably)
2. Add New Items (If I find any model that fit this mod's goal)
