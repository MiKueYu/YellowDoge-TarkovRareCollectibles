Do you remember the feeling of finding your first GPU? Do you still remember the excitement of discovering your first LEDX? Don't you feel that looting in Tarkov nowadays has become a lot more boring? Only marked keys, Lab key cards, and maybe LEDX still give you enough adrenaline. This mod aims to fix that.

Inspired by other extraction shooters like Arena Breakout: Infinite and Delta Force, **Tarkov Rare Collectibles** is a mod that adds rare collectible items to Escape from Tarkov. These items are highly valuable and extremely rare, often worth over 1 million rubles. Once you find them, you can sell them for a fortune or collect them in your Hall of Fame.

## Installation

1. Extract user/ folder to SPT root directory

## Item Spawn Tabset {.tabset}

### Adjust Loot Spawn Modifier

1. Open user/mods/yellowdoge-tarkovrarecollectibles/config/config.json

2. Adjust "staticLootMultiplier" to multiply the spawn rate for containers (value must be a number, or it will break the code). Adjust  "looseLootMultiplier" to multiply the spawn rate for items outside of containers.

3. The final spawn rate is calculated as "defaultSpawnRate" x "LootMultiplier". The defaultSpawnRate can be found on the other tabs.

4. Details on Item Spawn:
  - **Spawn Rate**: contains textual descriptions of where each item spawns
  - **Loose Loot Spawn Locations**: contains textual descriptions of each map's loose loot spawns
  - **Loose Loot Spawn Locations (Spoilers)**: contains images of each spawn point for loose loot spawns
