# YellowDoge-TarkovRareCollectibles

Do you remember the feeling of finding your first GPU? Do you still remember the excitement of discovering your first LEDX? Don't you feel that looting in Tarkov nowadays has become a lot more boring? Only marked keys, Lab key cards, and maybe LEDX still give you enough adrenaline. This mod aims to fix that.

Inspired by other extraction shooters like Arena Breakout: Infinite and Delta Force, **Tarkov Rare Collectibles** is a mod that adds rare collectible items to Escape from Tarkov. These items are highly valuable and extremely rare, often worth over 1 million rubles. Once you find them, you can sell them for a fortune or collect them in your Hall of Fame.

## TODO (Once I figure out how to)

1. Add Loose Loot Spawns (Power Cell/Deer Skull will be Loose Loot only probably)
2. Add Quests
3. Rebalance Container Loot Spawn per Quest/Lore
4. Add to Handbook, new category maybe
5. Add New Items (If I find any model that fit this mod's goal)

---

## Installation

1. Extract user/ folder to SPT root directory

## Lore & Spawn Location Hint

### 20-Carat Diamond
Fence: Listen, mercenery — you might be good at collecting those items, but there's a very rare gem that you've never seen before. My sources say a very rich merchant left his precious jewel in a safe when he escaped this place. Of course he's hiring people to look for it, but you — if you're lucky enough — might find it first. And let me tell you, there's a big paycheck for anyone who brings me the stone. I'll be waiting for your good news.

### 999.9 Gold Bar / Gold Clock / Gold Statue
Skier: Usually people don't care much about gold nowadays, but that's because they don't have a way to use it. I, on the other hand, have my ways to send goods to the outside world. So if you come across any gold bars, gold decorations, or anything made of pure gold, remember to come see me. I will make it worth your time. However, don't pester me with those fake gold statues that have only a thin layer of gold — those are not worth my time. Bring me only pure gold.

Peacekeeper: Peace is not cheap. My people are risking their lives to make this world a better place, yet money is always tight. And that's where you come in. I've got connections that will take some valuables for a good price — why don't you check those safes and see if there are any shiny bars lying around? I'll give you a decent cut; you won't regret it.

Prepor: I remember the days when I had a decent setup. Nowadays even my clock doesn't tick on time anymore. You know what — I heard there are rich people who put gold on their clocks. Do you know how much that costs? Well I do, since somebody's looking for one, with a big prize for the first to bring it. If you find that gold clock, bring it to me and I'll let him know you found it.

Ragman: Remember the guy who asked for those luxury items last time? Well, he got bored of those and now he wants a fully gold statue. You know, one that's basically solid gold, not the fake ones with just a gold layer on the outside. Anyway, you seem to know where to find that kind of stuff, so I trust you'll bring me one soon. I'll have your share prepared in advance.

### Pack of Weed
Therapist: I knew I could count on you, mercenary. The drug labs you found last time have been operating for a while now — I heard they have stashes all over the region. I have a request: can you please find some of those for me? Not only will we be able to disrupt their operations, those drugs, while dangerous, can also be useful to me. I know a thing or two and those ingredients can be turned into much-needed painkillers for my patients. Not the best quality, but what can you ask for in these harsh times?

Skier: I heard you're working with that doctor again. Now listen, there's a lot of opportunity in those goods — why don't you hand them to me and I'll make sure they get sold to the highest bidder. Do you really believe she's going to use those to save lives? It's all business, I'm telling you. You've been my business partner — why would I disappoint you?

### Mona Lisa Replica
Ragman: So look — apparently our big customer is no longer satisfied with just fine metals. He's looking for an art piece now. Of course it's not the real one, but apparently it's a replica made by some other famous artist. We believe the previous owner hid the piece in an underground cache. You should probably look for those.

### Antique Flintlock Replica
Jaeger: You have proven yourself to be a good sniper, and a good sniper must have a good weapon. There's a guy I know who's looking for a trophy to celebrate his hunts, but not an ordinary trophy. I've heard the museum in the city once had an exhibition with an antique flintlock. Maybe you can get that for him — he's willing to pay a lot. I'm not sure if the weapon is still there; maybe someone took it, or maybe it ended up in a weapon box, since it's a gun, you know.

### Military Recon Drone
Peacekeeper: We've lost our drones and you helped us recover the remains. However, that still doesn't mean we have a reliable way for recon. I think you're capable enough to help again, won't you? There are some smaller drones lying around, probably in wooden boxes. They can't spot from very far, but at least they can fly. For the time being, these will have to do.

Mechanic: Remember all those cameras I had you plant for me? They were really useful, but lacking in one department: they're fixed and can only surveil one area. There's a solution to that. I need you to bring me a drone — apparently there are a few either in the military or in the big shopping mall.

### Military Missile
Prapor: You're good at sneaking in military material, soldier. However, I've got a much harder task this time. It's highly classified material again — some military missiles, far more powerful than those old shells you found last time, but also probably much harder to find. I recommend checking the military base again. Relax, you're used to that place.

Peacekeeper: I heard you're looking for some highly dangerous military weapons. Normally I would suggest you stop, but this time the situation is different. I have a contact who would like to poke around something like that, and he's well connected with deep pockets. Maybe if you bring me what he's looking for, we can both benefit.

### Premium Champagne
Prapor: Good job bringing me that wine last time. You work hard and didn't try to fool me, so I'll let you in on a little secret. That liquor store in the city center — you remember that one? — actually has some top-tier stuff. If you look around again, you might find a bottle of HOXXOH champagne. If you don't find it there, somebody probably hid it in the city. In any case, you should be able to find it in the city center. If you do, I'll pay you well.

### TerraGroup Labs Emergency Power Cell
Mechanic: Have you been to the TerraGroup laboratory? Apparently they have secret tech to power their facilities. If you can find one for me, it would power my workshop for a very long time. I'm willing to write you the biggest check you've ever seen if you can bring one.

### Gold Deer Skull
Fence: So you've already encountered those hooded people, haven't you? They might be weird, but they've also got some of the rarest stuff out there. I heard they have a big, heavy gold statue they use during their rituals. Maybe you can track that down. This type of stuff goes for a lot on the market, and I'll make sure you get your cut.
